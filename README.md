# Quantum Electron Orbitals - 2D Animation
## Overview
According to quantum physics theory, particles can exhibit wave-like properties. Thus, this program creates a 2D animation to represent electron orbitals as wave packets, reflecting this quantum nature.

## Code Description
The script uses parameters for two different orbitals and creates a dynamic visualization over time. As mentioned above, each orbital is represented as a wave packet whose properties change over time, illustrating the probabilistic nature of electron positions in quantum mechanics.

### Parameters 
- `sigma1`, `k01`, `x0_1`: parameters for the first orbital (width, initial wave vector, initial position).
- `k02`, `x0_2`: parameters for the second orbital (initial wave vector, initial position).
- `x`: space coordinate.
- `t`: time coordinate.

## Usage
Run the script in MATLAB enviroment. Immediately after running the animation will display the evolution of the wave packets over time, with changes in position and probability density.
